Here are the detailed steps to set up a dual-boot system with Windows and Ubuntu:
 
1. **Backup Your Data**: Before proceeding, make sure to back up all important data from your Windows installation.
 
2. **Create Free Space**: Use the Disk Management tool in Windows to shrink the existing Windows partition and create free space for Ubuntu. Aim for at least 20-30GB of free space.
 
3. **Download Ubuntu**: Go to the official Ubuntu website and download the ISO file for the version you want to install.
 
4. **Create Bootable USB Drive**: Use a tool like Rufus (on Windows) or Etcher (on macOS or Linux) to create a bootable USB drive with the Ubuntu ISO.
 
5. **Access BIOS/UEFI Settings**: Restart your computer and access the BIOS or UEFI settings. This is typically done by pressing a specific key during boot (e.g., F2, Del, Esc).
 
6. **Change Boot Order**: In the BIOS/UEFI settings, change the boot order to prioritize booting from the USB drive. Save changes and exit.
 
7. **Boot from USB**: Restart your computer, and it should boot from the USB drive. You may need to press a key (e.g., F12, Esc) to bring up the boot menu and select the USB drive.
 
8. **Start Ubuntu Installation**: Once Ubuntu boots from the USB drive, select "Install Ubuntu" from the menu.
 
9. **Choose Installation Type**: During the installation process, choose the "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows" option. This will automatically allocate space for Ubuntu using the free space you created earlier.
 
10. **Follow Installation Prompts**: Follow the on-screen prompts to select your language, keyboard layout, time zone, and user account details.
 
11. **Partitioning**: If you prefer manual partitioning, you can choose the "Something else" option. Create a root (/) partition for Ubuntu and, optionally, a swap partition.
 
12. **Install Ubuntu**: Confirm your choices and proceed with the installation. Ubuntu will be installed alongside Windows.
 
13. **Complete Installation**: Once the installation is complete, restart your computer.
 
14. **Boot into Grub**: Upon restarting, you should see the Grub boot loader menu, which allows you to choose between Ubuntu and Windows. Select the desired OS to boot into.
 
15. **Update Ubuntu**: After booting into Ubuntu, make sure to run updates and install any necessary drivers or software.
 
That's it! You now have a dual-boot system with Windows and Ubuntu set up on your computer. You can choose which operating system to boot into each time you start your computer.
